# Lesson ↔ Material Mapping

Every lesson version anchors on a single primary Montessori material. Presentation, guided practice, and independent practice keep that material front and centre so learners build fluency through consistent manipulation.

## Multiplication

### Version: Golden Bead Multiplication
- **Primary material**: golden beads (units, tens, hundreds, thousands) with number cards and the multiplication ribbon
- **Segments**:
  - Presentation – scripted demonstration of `2344 × 3`
  - Guided practice – step-by-step exchanges and stacking
  - Independent practice – five generated four-digit-by-one-digit problems
- **Focus skill**: `skill.multiply-4-digit-by-1-digit`
- **Secondary materials**: none (paper recording happens alongside the bead work)

### Version: Stamp Game Multiplication
- **Primary material**: stamp game tiles (green 1s, blue 10s, red 100s)
- **Segments**:
  - Presentation – walkthrough of `321 × 3` and `543 × 4`
  - Guided practice – repeat columns, exchange stacks, read the product
  - Independent practice – five generated three-digit-by-one-digit problems
- **Focus skill**: `skill.multiply-3-digit-by-1-digit`
- **Secondary materials**: none; bead frame/abstract work will be authored as separate lessons later.

## Representation Metadata

All current segments use the `concrete` representation. When we extend to abstract notation (e.g., checkerboard, bead frame) we will annotate segments accordingly so sequencing rules can bridge concrete → abstract cleanly.

## Extension Strategy

- Future multiplication lessons (checkerboard, bead frame, long multiplication with stamps) will follow the same pattern: one primary material per lesson version, with optional variations guarded behind mastery checks.
- Regenerated problem sets keep learner journeys fresh on retake while preserving the same manipulative.
