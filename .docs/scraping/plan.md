Below is a first-principles blueprint you can use for K–2 and 2–5.

1) The primitives (what every “skill” reduces to)
A. Quantities & Representations

Representations (choose 1+ per skill): pictures/objects, ten-frames, fingers, tally, cubes/rods/flats, number word, numeral, number line/100 chart, array/groups, bar/area model, money/clock/unit strip.

Ranges: N≤5, N≤10, ≤20, ≤100, ≤120, ≤1000, etc.

Place value units: ones, tens, hundreds (later, thousands; decimals in 2–5 bands).

B. Operations on quantities

Count (with/without objects; forward/backward; skip-count by k).

Compare (match/bijection → count → symbols >,<,=).

Order/Locate (before/after/between; number line; 100 chart).

Compose/Decompose (make/break: 5, 10, teen, two-digit; regroup tens/ones).

Combine/Separate (add/subtract; fact families; make-ten; doubles ±1).

Scale/Partition (equal groups, arrays → multiplication/division; halves/fourths/eighths → fractions).

Name/Convert (words ↔ numerals; expanded ↔ standard; model ↔ symbol).

Measure/Graph (choose units/tools; read/produce tables, picture/bar/line plots).

Any item in your list is: (representation set) × (range) × (operation), plus optional context (money, clock, shapes).

2) Mastery atoms (smallest assessable targets)

Define each skill as a mastery atom:

<verb> <representation(s)> <range> [constraint] [context]

Examples:
- Count scattered pictures to 10
- Show numbers on ten-frames to 20
- One more/less to 120 (numerals)
- Compose teen numbers with tens/ones
- Compare sets by matching (≤10) → symbol
- Addition within 10 using make-10 on frames
- Compare numbers to 100 using words
- Fractions: show halves/fourths (area bars)


Keep the atoms small enough to check in ~30–60s.

3) Curriculum structure (graph, not a line)
Units (K–2 core; extend for 2–5)

Counting & Cardinality (0–10→20→100/120)

Compare & Order (sets → numbers → lines/charts)

Place Value & Composition (teen → two-digit → regroup)

Add/Subtract within 10/20 (models → strategies → equations)

Skip-count & Patterns (2/5/10; base-ten jumps)

Shapes & Attributes (2D/3D; compose/partition)

Measurement & Data (units/tools; picture/bar/line plots)

Fractions (early) (halves/fourths/eighths; unit fractions)

For 2–5, add: larger place value, rounding, multi-digit +/−/×/÷, decimal/fraction ops, ratio/rate, coordinate plane, angle/area/volume, statistics.

Lessons (within a unit)

Each Lesson targets one coherent concept across at least two representations, with a strategy objective.

Template:

Concept: e.g., “Make Ten to Add”

Representations: frames + number line

Strategy: pair to 10; count-on

Range: within 10 (later within 20)

Activities (interactive, error-controlled): see §4

Practice: focused drilling + spaced review

Mastery check: 90%+ accuracy, median latency threshold, strategy observed

4) Activity types (the “games” that teach)

Re-use 6 activity shells; vary parameters to cover nearly every atom:

Ten-Frame Lab — place/remove counters; one-more/less; make-ten; teen composition.

Set Matcher — match bijection, then select >,<,= (words→symbols).

Number Line Runner — locate/next/before/after; skip-count; fill ticks; compare by position.

Place-Value Factory — build/break teen/two-digit; expanded↔standard; regroup.

Operation Machine — combine/take-away; model↔equation↔story; strategies (make-ten, doubles).

Shape & Measure Studio — ID/sort/compose/partition; measure/choose unit; make/interpret graphs.

Each activity enforces control of error (immediate, non-punitive feedback, and scaffold if two errors appear).

5) Practice (fluency & review)

Fluency shell: “Tempo Grid” (one-problem focus, metronome pacing, minimal visuals).

Item scheduler: spaced repetition by atom; inject latest lesson items + a rolling window of prior weak items.

Signals: per-atom accuracy, latency, hint use → adapt next queue (more of weak facts, rotate representations).

6) Progression by RIT band (how difficulty scales)

Keep the same activity, scale the parameters:

RIT <145

Ranges: ≤5, ≤10.

Reps: pictures, frames, cubes.

Verbs: count, one-more/less, compare by matching, identify numbers/words.

Activities: Ten-Frame Lab, Set Matcher, Number Line Runner (0–10), Operation Machine (to 5).

RIT 146–158

Ranges: to 20; before/after/between; mixed groups; compare numbers to 20.

Add Place-Value Factory (compose/decompose to 20); Number Line Runner on 100-chart micro-windows.

RIT 159–167

Teen composition; two-digit with models; ten more/less; facts within 10; model↔equation.

Strategies (doubles ±1, make-ten) introduced in Operation Machine.

RIT 168–175

To 120; expanded form; compare/order to 120; partition halves/fourths; skip-count 2/5/10 robustly.

RIT 176–194

Number lines to 1000; rounding; hundreds place; scaled graphs; basic perimeter/area; early fractions.

RIT 195+ (2–5)

Multi-digit +/−/×/÷, decimal/fraction operations, ratio/rate, coordinate plane, angle/area/volume, histograms/box plots.

Same shells extend: Number Line Runner handles decimals/fractions; Place-Value Factory handles decimals; Operation Machine handles fraction/decimal models.

7) Mastery & movement rules

Lesson mastery (per atom):

≥90% accuracy, median latency under target (e.g., ≤3–5s), zero critical errors (mis-operation), two representations verified.

Spiral: Every practice session contains 20–40% review (weakest atoms in last 2–4 weeks).

Promotion: Advance range first (e.g., 10→20), then abstraction (model → symbol), then transfer (new rep/context).

Fallbacks: If misses cluster, auto-switch representation (e.g., numerals → frames) and re-teach with scaffold.

8) Example: how a few of your items slot in

“Learn to count to 10 / Count pictures/scattered/rows/rings” → Counting & Cardinality → Lesson 1

Activities: Ten-Frame Lab (free fill), Set Matcher (count-to-card), Number Line Runner (0–10 next).

Practice: Tempo Grid on “next number” + picture counts.

“Compare by matching/counting / Fewer, more, same” → Compare & Order → Lesson 1

Activities: Set Matcher (bijection → verbal → symbol), Number Line compare.

Practice: two-choice compare (calm drill).

“Build/break teen numbers / Place value models up to 20/120” → Place Value → Lessons 1–3

Activities: Place-Value Factory (tens+ones), Ten-Frame Lab (make-ten → teen), later regrouping.

Practice: quick “compose/decompose” prompts on Tempo Grid.

“Addition within 10/20 / Make a number / Which model matches?” → Operations → Lessons 1–4

Activities: Operation Machine (model↔equation↔story), Ten-Frame Lab (make-ten), Number Line jump.

Practice: Tempo Grid facts with strategy nudges on error.

“Halves/fourths/eighths / Unit fractions on number lines” → Fractions (early) → Lessons 1–3

Activities: Shape & Measure (partition), Number Line Runner (unit fraction ticks).

Practice: quick ID/placement drills.

9) Authoring model (so this scales)

Represent each lesson/activity as data, not code:

{
  "unit": "Place Value",
  "lesson": "Compose teen numbers",
  "atoms": [
    {"verb":"compose","rep":["ten-frame","tens-ones"],"range":20,"strategy":"make-ten"},
    {"verb":"convert","rep":["tens-ones","numeral"],"range":20}
  ],
  "activities": [
    {"type":"TenFrameLab","params":{"targetN":[11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19],"scaffold":"row-first"}},
    {"type":"PlaceValueFactory","params":{"tensOnes":true,"expandedForm":false}}
  ],
  "practice": {"mode":"tempo-grid","mix":["latest","weak-last-30d"],"time_s":180}
}

10) Is your “lesson → activities → practice” mental model right?

Yes. That’s the right spine:

Unit = coherent strand progression.

Lesson = one concept across ≥2 representations + one explicit strategy.

Activities = short, interactive, with control of error (teach/diagnose).

Practice = calm, focused drilling that blends new atoms + spaced review of old weak atoms.

Add two guardrails:

Always teach with at least two representations before symbolic practice.

Practice queue must remember weaknesses (per atom) and bring them back on an expanding schedule.

If this framing looks right, tell me which unit you want to flesh out first (e.g., “Counting & Cardinality for RIT <145” or “Place Value to 120 for 168–175”). I’ll draft 4–6 lessons with atom lists, activity parameters, mastery checks, and a practice mix you can ship.
