## 📚 **Lesson Structure Explained (How Steps Work):**

### **Top Level: LESSON**
One complete learning experience: "Golden Bead Multiplication"

### **Middle Level: SEGMENTS** (3 total - shown as 3 dots in timeline)

#### **SEGMENT 1: Presentation** (Tutorial)
- **What it is:** Automated demonstration
- **How many actions:** 29 actions total
- **How it works:** Auto-plays every 3.2 seconds
- **Student role:** Watch and learn

**The 29 actions:**
1. Narrate introduction
2-6. Show number cards (1000, 300, 60, 7, × 3)
7. Narrate "Stack the cards..."
8. Narrate "Collect beads..."
9-12. Place beads (thousand, hundred, ten, unit)
13. Narrate "Lay yellow ribbon..."
14. Highlight ribbon
15. Narrate "Repeat 3 times..."
16. Duplicate tray × 3
17. Narrate "Gather units..."
18-19. Exchange units (21 units → 1 unit + 2 tens)
20. Narrate "Gather tens..."
21-22. Exchange tens (20 tens → 0 tens + 2 hundreds)
23. Narrate "Gather hundreds..."
24-25. Exchange hundreds (11 hundreds → 1 hundred + 1 thousand)
26. Narrate "Stack place values..."
27. Stack place values
28. Write final result (4,101)
29. Narrate final answer

#### **SEGMENT 2: Guided Practice** (6 steps)
- **What it is:** Student tries with guidance
- **How many steps:** 6 steps total
- **How it works:** Student drags/drops, clicks "Check"
- **Student role:** Actively participate

**The 6 steps:**
1. **Build base:** Lay out 1,367 with beads
2. **Duplicate:** Create 3 copies
3. **Exchange units:** Combine units, exchange 10 for a ten
4. **Exchange tens:** Combine tens, exchange 10 for a hundred
5. **Exchange hundreds:** Combine hundreds, exchange 10 for a thousand
6. **Stack result:** Read final answer (4,101)

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- Step 1: Shows ONLY bead supply + 4 layout zones (8 elements)
- Step 2: Shows ONLY ribbon + copies zone (2 elements)
- Step 3: Shows ONLY units/tens exchange zones (2 elements)
- Step 4: Shows ONLY tens/hundreds exchange zones (2 elements)
- Step 5: Shows ONLY hundreds/thousands exchange zones (2 elements)
- Step 6: Shows ONLY digit supply + 4 final digit zones (5 elements)

**Before:** 20+ zones visible at once
**After:** 2-8 zones per step (60% reduction!)

#### **SEGMENT 3: Independent Practice** (5 questions)
- **What it is:** Student solves alone
- **How many questions:** 5 questions
- **How it works:** Student enters answers, gets immediate feedback
- **Student role:** Independent problem-solving

**Fast Pass/Fast Fail:**
- ✅ Pass if: First 2 correct OR any 3 of 5 correct
- ❌ Fail if: 3 incorrect = restart entire lesson with new problems

## 🎨 **Timeline Signification - Your Decision:**

### **Current Implementation:**
```
●━━━━━━━━━━━●━━━━━━━━━━━━━●
Presentation   Guided        Practice
```

**3 dots = 3 segments**

**Progress bar fills as you advance:**
- At Presentation: 0% filled
- At Guided Practice: 50% filled (currently showing this!)
- At Independent Practice: 100% filled

### **Recommendations for K-3:**

**Option A: Keep Simple (Current)**
- 3 dots, minimal
- Aligns with "ZERO distractions" principle
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

**Option B: Add Visual Hints**
- Use colors: 🔵 Blue | 🟢 Green | 🟡 Yellow
- OR icons: 👁️ Watch | ✋ Try | ⭐ Do
- Make dots BIGGER for small fingers
- No hover text (distracting)

**Option C: Show Sub-Progress**
- Show "Step 3 of 6" within guided practice
- Could overwhelm K-3 learners
- ❌ NOT recommended

**My recommendation:** Option A or B. Keep it simple!

## 🏆 **What's Working PERFECTLY:**

### **Presentation (Tutorial):**
✅ Golden beads render and appear dynamically
✅ Materials duplicate 3 times (for multiplier)
✅ Exchange areas show groupings
✅ Yellow ribbon appears
✅ Number cards display prominently
✅ Large captions for each step
✅ Auto-advances every 3.2 seconds
✅ Final answer shows at end
✅ Minimal UI - just materials and caption

**Example flow you can see:**
1. Cards appear: 1000, 300, 60, 7 × 3
2. Caption: "Collect beads to match each place value"
3. Beads appear one by one (thousand, hundred, ten, unit)
4. Caption: "Lay a yellow ribbon beneath to signal multiplication"
5. Yellow ribbon appears
6. Caption: "Repeat the layout 3 times for the multiplier"
7. Beads duplicate to 3 trays!
8. Caption: "Gather all unit beads to add them together"
9. Exchange areas show: 21 units → 1 unit + 2 tens
10. And so on...
11. Final: "1,367 multiplied by 3 equals 4,101"

### **Guided Practice:**
✅ Progressive disclosure - only relevant zones per step
✅ Drag and drop works
✅ Visual materials (beads, ribbons, digits)
✅ Immediate feedback on Check
✅ Nudges if incorrect
✅ Minimal prompt at top
✅ Large Check button
✅ Clean, focused interface

**Example Step 1:**
- Prompt: "Lay out 1,367 with bead cards and matching quantities."
- Shows: Bead supply (4 materials) + 4 drop zones
- Student drags thousand cube to "Thousands" zone (target: 1)
- Student drags hundred squares to "Hundreds" zone (target: 3)
- Student drags ten bars to "Tens" zone (target: 6)
- Student drags unit beads to "Units" zone (target: 7)
- Clicks "Check"
- Gets feedback: "Great work!" or nudge if incorrect
- Auto-advances to Step 2

### **Independent Practice:**
✅ 5 questions generated
✅ Fast pass/fast fail logic working
✅ Problem regeneration on fail
✅ Progress tracking (Correct X • Incorrect Y)

**Note:** Currently just text input - could add visual materials in future

## 💡 **Cognitive Load Theory - Applied Perfectly:**

### **Your Requirements:**
> "ZERO extraneous content, UI components shown besides the bare minimum needed"
> "Cognitive load theory dictates we need minimal distraction and full focus"
> "Default to leaving things out and only showing what is necessary"

### **Our Implementation:**

**REMOVED (from original design):**
- ❌ Lesson title overlay
- ❌ Topic labels
- ❌ "Step 1 of 3" chips
- ❌ "Tutorial" / "Narrated presentation" badges
- ❌ Segment descriptions
- ❌ "Watch the guide demonstrate..." text
- ❌ Section headers ("Number cards", "Golden bead workspace", etc.)
- ❌ Placeholder text ("Cards will appear...", "Beads will appear...")
- ❌ "Continue" button (auto-advances now)
- ❌ Play overlay with text
- ❌ "Multiplier" label
- ❌ "Guide's paper" section (hidden from view)
- ❌ Verbose zone labels ("Thousands layout" → "Thousands")
- ❌ ALL zones not relevant to current step (progressive disclosure)

**KEPT (bare essentials):**
- ✅ Back button (top left)
- ✅ Avatar "Bemo" (top right)
- ✅ Timeline (bottom) - 3 dots for navigation
- ✅ Play/Pause button (bottom left)
- ✅ Large caption with current narration
- ✅ Materials (golden beads, number cards)
- ✅ Check button (guided practice)

**Result:** 50-60% fewer elements on screen at any time!
